# Category Theory and Functional Programming Collaborative Learning

## Hello and welcome!
You've found our collaborative learning group focusing on category theory and functional programming. Whether you have come intentionally or just happened to stumble across this repo, you are more welcome here! Please join us.

## "Manifesto"
We like category theory and functional programming and want to meet to discuss the ideas in this area.

## Hopes and Dreams
The goal is to have a meeting at least every 2 weeks on Saturdays at 18:00 UTC (1:00PM EST). Our first meeting will be Saturday, February 15, 2020.

I hope that people will come with topics of discussion in mind and eventually we will have suggestions for topics they want cover/present.

## Where to find us
