# Category Theory and Functional Programming Collaborative Learning

## Hello and welcome!
You've found our collaborative learning group focusing on category theory and functional programming. Whether you have come intentionally or just happened to stumble across this repo, you are more welcome here! Please feel free join us for one of our learning sessions.

## "Manifesto"
We like category theory and functional programming and want to meet to discuss the ideas in these areas.

## Hopes and Dreams
The goal is to have a meeting at least every 2 weeks on Saturdays at 18:00 UTC (1:00PM EST). Our first meeting will be Saturday, February 15, 2020.

I hope that people will contribute topics of discussion and eventually we will have suggestions for topics participants want to cover/present.
