# Yoneda Lemma Discussion

## Hom set
The set of morphisms between two objects `a`, `b` in a category `C`.

Denoted `C(a, b)`

## Hom functor
Fix an object `a` in a category `C`.

The mapping from the category `C` to the category `Set` which takes an object `b` in `C` to the hom set `C(a, b)` and morphism `f :: x -> y` in `C` to the function `C(a, f): C(a, x) -> C(a, y)` (given by `C(a, f x)`, i.e. composition with `f`).

Denoted `C(a, -): C -> Set`

This hom functor is *covariant*. There is also a *contravariant* version where instead of fixing the source object, we fix the target object, i.e. `C(-, b)`. A contravariant functor `F: C -> D` means `F` is a functor on the opposite category, i.e. `F: C^op -> D` is a (covariant) functor.

(The opposite category `C^op` has the same objects as `C`, the morphisms are just flipped around, i.e. `f :: a -> b` in `C` iff `f* :: b -> a` in `C^op`.)

## Functor category
Given two categories `C` and `D`, we can talk about functors `F: C -> D`. The collection of all functors between two categories also forms a category, called the *functor category*, the objects are functors and the morphisms are natural transformations.

Denoted `[C, D]`

## Yoneda lemma
Given any functor `F: C -> Set`, the set of natural transformations between the hom functor `C(a, -)` and `F` is (naturally) isomorphic to the image of `a` under `F`; in math symbols:
```
  [C, Set](C(a, -), F) ~ F a
```

### Example
`F = C(b, -): C -> Set`

Yoneda lemma => `[C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) ~ C(b, a)`

In Haskell syntax, this says:
```
  forall x. (a -> x) -> b -> x = b -> a
```

Let `f :: a -> x` in `C(a, x)` and `g :: b -> x` in `C(b, x)`.

In other words, given the function `f :: a -> x` and type `b`, we want to make a function `g :: b -> x`. Yoneda says there's only one way to do this, by defining a function `h :: b -> a` and making `g = f . h`, i.e. applying `h` first, then `f`.


Here's a terrible diagram which attempts to depict this:

```
       f
    a --> x
    ^    ^
    .   /
  h .  / g
    . /
    b
```
